    <p>Yogurt is fairly easy to make at home and the result is much better in flavor and consistency than most commercial yogurt. You'll save money making your own, and also be able to choose what does or doesn't go into your yogurt (commercial brands often include thickeners and other non-dairy ingredients).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart/1 liter milk</li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons yogurt (with active cultures: all commercial brands will state on the container if the yogurt contains active cultures.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Gently heat the milk over medium-low heat until it reaches 180°F/820C. Turn off the heat and the milk cool down to between 106°F/41°C and 110°F/43°C.</li>
        <li> While the heated milk is cooling, wash the jars and leave them filled with hot water so the glass will be warm when you add the yogu t.</li>
        <li> When the milk has cooled enough, warm a large bowl or measuring cup by filling it with hot water. Empty out the water. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer into the warmed bowl. Whisk in the yogurt. Pour out the water in the jars and pour in the milk plus yogurt mixture. Fasten the lids </li>
        <li> Place the jars in a warm but not hot place where they can remain undisturbed for 8 hours or overnight. An old fashioned oven in which the pilot light is always on is perfect. So is an oven with the light turned on but the heat off. Another option is a food dehydrator set to 110°F/43°C with the trays removed to make room for the jars. Or you could buy a special yogurt maker that maintains the ideal temperature.</li>
        <li> Be careful <b><i>not</i></b> to jostle the jars while the active yogurt cultures are working on the milk. Yogurt is very finicky about this, and will sometimes not set up well if the jars are moved during this period.</li>
        <li> Transfer the jars to the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
